# Memory-Game-Storyline

<a href="https://itsdani.me/sl/memorygame/story.html">Live Demo</a>

This is a game created in Articulate Storyline 3. It is a simple memory game where you try to find matching pairs, only in this case the pairs are not identical - you are instead matching flute fingerings to their equivalent notes on the treble clef.

There are three stages in order to include all the notes I wanted to use for this student. The cards are shuffled at the beginning of each stage, giving a completely different game every time. Variables were used to instruct the game when to flip cards back over or change to the disabled (correct/match found) state. After all cards have changed to the disabled state, a win screen appears with the option to keep playing.
